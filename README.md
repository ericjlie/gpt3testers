# gpt3testers
A couple of gpt3 testers that run in the terminal.

#How to use

To run a tester, navigate to  use the command:

---
TOKEN=YOUR_API_TOKEN_HERE node JSFILENAME_HERE
---

Most parameters can be adjusted by looking at the gpt3.js file, then altering the parameters passed in for each tester module.
Details about each parameter and what they do can be found at the OpenAI GPT3 documentation.

Sorry it's a bit messy I made this in like 20 minutes.
